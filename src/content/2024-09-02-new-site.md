Back in 2018, I created my first portfolio website by forking Zeno Rocha’s site and adding my own branding. 
Even with eight years of experience, having a personal portfolio was a game-changer—it helped me land 
my first remote job with a U.S. startup.

Now, I’ve built a brand-new portfolio from scratch using Next.js and Radix themes.
This time, I added my own touches, like a video animation that also transitions into dark mode.
I drew inspiration from [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/), [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/),
and various portfolios from [this repo](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios).
I’m taking full advantage of Markdown, which allows me to easily update the site content directly 
rom the GitHub repository.

The new site includes an “About” section with a brief overview of my career and a “Projects” section 
showcasing the main public work I’ve done as a software engineer. I’m really satisfied with the results, 
and I’m excited to share this updated reflection of my journey.
